# RTL Design for ALSU

This repository contains the Verilog code and testbenches for the Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALSU) design. The ALSU is a core component of a simple processor, and this project focuses on the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design of the ALSU.

## Introduction
The Arithmetic Logic Shift Unit (ALSU) is a crucial component of a processor that performs various arithmetic, logical, and shift operations. This repository provides the RTL design and implementation of an ALSU, which can be used as a building block for a larger processor design.

---

## Design
The ALSU design is implemented in Verilog HDL and is structured as follows:
```

```

## Features
The ALSU in this repository supports the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- AND
- OR
- NOT
- Left Shift
- Right Shift

The main components of the ALSU design are:
- `Register.v`: The top-level module that integrates the ALSU and it's registers.
- `alsu.v`: The ALSU module.

The `testbench` directory contains the testbench file `testbench.v` for verifying the ALSU functionality.

    ```ruby
        https://github.com/Abdelrahman1810/RTL-Design-for-ALSU.git
    ```
2. Open QuestaSim and navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
3. Compile the Verilog files by executing the following command in the QuestaSim transcript tap: 

    ```ruby
    do run.do
    ```
